This repository contains our group project for the Operating Systems course at HKPolyU. The project simulates a parking management system, incorporating key OS concepts such as multiprocessing, inter-process communication (IPC), synchronization, scheduling algorithms (FCFS and Priority), and resource management.

Note: While the system is functional, there may be minor bugs or edge cases that could require further refinement. Additionally, error handling is limited, as it was not a primary requirement for the project, as specified by our instructor.
